All files required to run our code are in the root folder of the files contained in this zip file. The contents are described below.

## ipynb file:
Group124_A2.ipynb

The ipynb contains all the cells necessary to run each model described in the accompanying document. Before running each model, cell sections labelled 1 through to 6 need to be run. Then selected models are presented in cell sections 7.1 to 7.13, before a final complete ablation study in section 8

## data:
test.csv
train.csv
val.csv

This is the original data provided for the assignment and needs to be in same folder as the ipynb file.

## training_validation_report_output:
This folder contains the ipynb terminal output for the training and validation of each of the selected models. The file naming convention is 7_X_train or 7_X_report where the 7_X corresponds to the section in the notebook.

## trained_models:
